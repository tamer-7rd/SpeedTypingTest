    "The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. But she was late and didn't have a choice, so she climbed in reluctantly.",
    "There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he still managed to function in society.",

    "The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. Dave knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. With the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't last, he prepared himself.",
    "It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice, but something told her to reconsider.",
    "They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. No one questioned why it was green.",
    "She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out of her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready, but the moment wasn't quite right yet.",

    "The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath, jealous of the attention the ball always seemed to receive.",
